"""Deterministic downstream RNG helpers for dataset planning.

The responsibility of this auxiliary module is deliberately narrow: dataset
code may derive stable planning seeds and construct NumPy
generators after the semantic program has already been chosen. This module
does not own Seed laws, Rule laws, canonical replay coordinates, application
evidence, or any transition behavior; those remain closed semantic data and
``program.py`` responsibilities.

These helpers are intentionally ordinary downstream utilities. They do not
participate in program identity and are not imported by the semantic core.
