"""Rule catalog factories for next-state update laws.

This module defines rule-type primitives and named rule families for
cellular-automata style next-state generation. A rule is the update interface:
it receives already-gathered neighborhood component reads and returns the next
raw value for one update site.

The construction hierarchy mirrors `neighborhoods.py`:

- Rule-type primitives describe how one neighborhood component is summarized,
  such as exhaustive, totalistic, or gated totalistic channels.
- Output rules consume one or more summarized channels, either through a lookup
  family or through a formulaic callable.
- Named experiment families are built by composing the primitives rather than
  duplicating component logic.

This keeps spatial construction in neighborhoods/frontiers, value-space
construction in alphabets, and rollout mechanics in `rollout.py`. Callers
choose the alphabet, neighborhood, frontier, seed, shape, horizon, and named
rule family.
